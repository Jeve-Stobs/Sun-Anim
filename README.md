# OMG my first README FILE

I messed this up the first time lol. So here we go again. I messed up the ReadME not the code that was flawless. 
## Installation

Just open the website you nerd: https://Photosynthesis.thedailypong.repl.co
Not everything is complicated.
## Usage

```python
import schoolproj

schoolproj.doWork('WORK') # returns 'I'm not that smart'
schoolproj.solveMath('2+2') # returns '2+2=5'
```
